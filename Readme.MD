**Student teams have a choice to work on three possible projects:**
1. Tier-based pricing model (based primarily on Amazon Web Services products)
2. Design and development of a back-end analytics program
3. Design and development of an email communication process that delivers customizable
notifications to users.
and right to work agreement. Will be provided to students who are interested in
discussing the project.
**Learning Goals**:
### Students will work with a new funded faculty-driven startup at ASU. School Fuel is a subscription-based service that provides K-12 principals and teachers with:
- Individualized, student-level recommendations to SOLVE underachievement issues
- Recommendations can be implemented in MINUTES rather than Months
- Processes that support and enhance the professional learning community model used in
schools
- A service that does not require new software or hardware and minimal user training
AWS implementation with regards to School Fuel

**Deliverables**: Each time is expected to deliver external and internal specifications for their assignment projects along with working prototype (i.e. solution implemented with a test environment). The project team should  expect to meet with faculty lead on a weekly or biweekly basis. Student teams will have direct input on specifications and deliverables as part of this learning experience/collaboration.
